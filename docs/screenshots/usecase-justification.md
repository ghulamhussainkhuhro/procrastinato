## **Step 1 – Use Case of procratinato**

**Use Case:**
*Procrastinato* is a productivity-roast chatbot that uses sharp wit, sarcasm, and playful insults to push users out of procrastination. Instead of gentle motivation, it delivers “tough love” in a humorous, memorable way.

**Target Users:**

* Students delaying assignments
* Young professionals stuck on work tasks
* Anyone who prefers sarcastic accountability over motivational quotes

**Expected Benefits:**

* Makes productivity fun by turning laziness into a joke
* Keeps users accountable while entertaining them
* Creates a memorable user experience that encourages repeat engagement

**Limitations:**

* Not suitable for users who prefer encouragement or are sensitive to criticism
* Requires a disclaimer (not intended for serious mental health use)
* Needs prompt controls to prevent overly harsh responses

## **Step 2 – Justification**

### Why This Problem is Worth Solving

Procrastination is universal, but most productivity apps rely on polite reminders or motivational quotes. These often feel repetitive and easy to ignore. *Procrastinato* flips the script: it leverages humor and “roast culture” to make accountability engaging and harder to dismiss.

### What Makes *Procrastinato* Different

1. **Unique Concept:**

   * Roast-based productivity bots are rare.
   * Its edgy, funny personality makes it stand out from generic chatbots.

2. **Portfolio Impact:**

   * Demonstrates creativity in designing personality-driven AI.
   * Recruiters will remember a project that’s both fun and technically sound.

3. **Technical Showcase:**

   * Prompt engineering for personality anchoring (ensuring it stays in roast-mode).
   * Guardrails to prevent breaking character.
   * Potential extensions like roast libraries, categories (study, fitness, career), and leaderboards.

4. **Practical Deployment:**

   * Easy to deploy with Streamlit or Gradio for live interaction.
   * Can be shared in a portfolio or demo link to attract attention.

5. **Resume-Ready Project:**
   Example entry:

   > **Procrastinato – The Merciless Roast Bot**
